# Goal

In this tutorial, we are going to see a way to calibrate an electronic device by means of making several measures of the variables of interest provided by the device and the already known values of the target variable, via univariate linear regression.

## Dependencies
I recommend installing Anaconda to manage all the dependencies if you run it locally; in case you use some cloud platform, you should not have much problem running the notebook, where dependencies should be already included.

## Tips & tricks
To correctly visualize the python notebook, either download it and open it with Jupyter or click on the 'nbviewer' option available in the .ipynb here in GitHub
